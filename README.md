# Command Line Rust

This is the repo housing my solutions for [Command Line Rust](https://github.com/kyclark/command-line-rust)

There's a few subtle changes from the book, mostly versions of dependencies and the fact I much prefer [clap's](https://crates.io/crates/clap) derive API so I use that where I can.
